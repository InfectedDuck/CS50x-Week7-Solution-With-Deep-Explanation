    1.If they have access to the top 100 songs of the person, they may recommend some songs based on the averages of those variables like energy.
If the person loved songs with the high levels of energy, it can be said that the person loves high-intensed and dynamic music.
By calculating others, and just recommending songs with the most close values, spotify can make a good playlist for the person.
User may like high energic, but with low valence and low danceability, and spotify will search what songs have closest variables to those.
For instance, if he has average of 0.33 valence, and 0.88 energy, songs will be suggested with 0.34 valence and 0.87 energy.
    2.Firstly, maybe the tastes of the person have changed very much, during the last year, so he may not like the songs with high energy, as he liked
last year. Secondly, only the averages of those variables may not really help the person, as he may like songs with both low and high danceability,
not just only medium danceability. Thirdly, music can be listened during work outs, studying, or just chilling, so it is not really good choice
to collect all music in one, not only activity, but also the time of the day may affect. How could the sad music being listened at the romantic
night could be in one place with the energetic music that is played during the day? Therefore, it is not really correct to parse all those
songs just by analyzing variables. However, I propose that to make a good playlist analysis of daily activity and daytime is necessary,
maybe using an AI that will analyze the given information and divide the songs to the group of studying, working out, playing groups will be
much more efficient. Like, putting all the playlist with those groups maybe some others like nightly romantic, or daily active playlists into one
playlist of wrapped, so that the person can choose the playlist based on the activity he is doing.
